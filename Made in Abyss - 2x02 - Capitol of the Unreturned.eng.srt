1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS SCENES THAT MAY
MAY OFFEND VIEWERS' SENSIBILITIES.
IT IS INTENDED FOR AN INFORMED PUBLIC.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,270
I remember it perfectly.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,380
It was a completely different world.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,490
"The golden city
with superhuman inhabitants."

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,490
It was so vast, so disproportionate,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,440
so colossal...

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,800
far more
than we could endure.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,000
How hot it is!

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,400
Rumors spoke
of a city of gold in the depths.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,890
Yes, someone must have come down
and sent a dispatch balloon.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,470
What could this building
be?

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,310
- Be careful.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,180
It's made of crystals.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,490
- You're not hurt?
- No, I'm not hurt.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,720
Take a look,
there's a building in the middle!

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,670
What is it?
How was it made?

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,670
A city on the surface
that has sunk?

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,400
It's completely fossilized,

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,810
or is it a mirage
created by the crystals?

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,740
I have no idea!

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,000
This place is a real mystery!

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,060
THE GLOWING CITY OF GOLD

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,030
THE CITY OF NO RETURN

24
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,780
Rico, sorry to break the mood.

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,430
Currents of consciousness
come together.

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,860
Let's find a safer place
to camp.

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,060
All right.

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,570
Nanatchy,

29
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,550
would you have a large sheet
on which to draw a map?

30
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,450
Your mother didn't?

31
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,560
No, she talks
about food.

32
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,060
So as not to spoil your discovery,
I suppose.

33
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,600
In this case, I pass in front
to observe the force field.

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,950
Give the orders, boss.

35
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,090
I'm a chef!

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,410
Légu, how are your wounds?
Can you watch our backs?

37
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,580
Yes, I'll take care of it.

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,730
The three and a half of us,

39
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,780
we managed to get down
without any major problems.

40
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,010
It can be done,
even without a White Whistle in the group.

41
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,490
They had to impose this rule
to make themselves important.

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,230
Ask
the next person we meet!

43
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,750
Without me.

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,290
It'll be someone twisted again.

45
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,600
The 6th level,
from which no human can return.

46
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,790
The non-return.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,380
A hippodragon.

48
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,740
"Their poisonous scales
explode at the slightest impact.

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,620
Fighting between males
are physical and very violent.

50
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,940
They are stubborn
and the curse doesn't affect them."

51
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,630
- Can we beat it?
- On the 6th level,

52
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,750
one is as dangerous
as a swarm of swindlers."

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,390
No way.

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,390
Those...
seem to be magpies.

55
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,090
They live near geysers
and are very docile.

56
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,040
Near geysers?
I don't see any.

57
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,640
Can you eat it?

58
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,420
"Their fresh eggs are delicious.

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,410
Come and see for yourself!

60
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,260
Must be the eggs.

61
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,230
They're on the move!

62
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,790
They're not freshly laid.

63
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,520
Unlike Mom,
we're going to taste them freshly hatched!

64
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,320
Are we really going to eat this?

65
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,560
Where does this light come from?

66
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,870
What was it?

67
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,330
Careful, it's poison!

68
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,470
What is it?

69
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,480
Let's get out of here!

70
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,420
Run for it!

71
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,160
Is this what
your mother calls geysers?

72
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,250
It takes guts
to build a nest in there.

73
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,700
They looked like big bubbles.

74
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,980
May I ask
why it amuses you?

75
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,890
Tada!

76
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,760
It's strong,
for holding up.

77
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,270
- Is it drinkable?
- Boiled is fine.

78
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,270
COOKED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

79
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,150
I'm so hungry,
hurry up and open them...

80
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,260
TASTY SMELL OF MEAT

81
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,900
Did it survive the baking?

82
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,920
He looks dead.

83
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,220
It's a muscular reaction.

84
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,670
Even after boiling,
the muscles haven't melted...

85
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,240
How is this possible?

86
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,030
I would have preferred
a freshly laid egg.

87
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,580
Are you serious?
You're going to eat that?

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,330
LE GOÛTEUR

89
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,340
Is it still moving?

90
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,000
Is it any good?

91
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,070
- Go ahead, Rico, taste it.
- Uh...

92
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,510
You should be able to cook this
just like last time.

93
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,850
What the hell are you talking about?

94
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,030
Yes !

95
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,010
No, Rico!
I don't like those things!

96
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,160
They are ground into powder,

97
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,120
the meat,

98
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,550
and fry!

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,060
FRIED POUSSIN À LA RICO

100
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,060
MORE OR LESS APPETIZING

101
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,060
They're still moving!

102
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,250
Although I have to admit
it smells great.

103
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,560
- Delicious!
- Yes, you get used to it.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
Is it too hot?

105
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,830
Yes...

106
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,090
Great!

107
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,200
- It burns...
- Here, drink. Eat slowly.

108
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,930
it's weird,
I feel like I've eaten this before.

109
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,070
Not me.

110
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,980
It's coming back to me!

111
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,880
It was a foreign dish
for the fête des caverniers!

112
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,550
I can't remember what it's called,

113
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,740
but it tasted just the same!

114
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,370
Nut had loved it so much
that he stole the others' share.

115
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,680
Nut?

116
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,840
One of Orse's children
we told you about.

117
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,770
This is Nut.

118
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,690
Shiggy and Kiyui.

119
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,410
And our boss.
I hope they're okay.

120
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,820
Don't worry about them,
you won't see them again.

121
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,400
But as long as you're in the Abyss,
you're bound to the other caverniers.

122
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,080
If it bothers you so much,
send them a letter.

123
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,030
Of course!
Let's write them a letter!

124
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
Rico's gang has reached
to the 6th level.

125
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,540
We have to tell them about it!

126
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,870
Are you really going to call us
"Rico's gang"?

127
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,300
It's basic.

128
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,550
That's the best I can do right now.

129
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,030
Names aren't his strong point.

130
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,020
To me,
she gave me a dog's name.

131
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,080
It's perfect for you.

132
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,700
That's it, I'm done.

133
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,310
Thanks, Nanatchy!

134
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,000
You're including yourself too, aren't you?

135
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,320
That's right, dummy.
Nobody's gonna come looking for me here.

136
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,820
With anti-insect and bird oil,
it's ready!

137
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,330
- The weight should be fine.
- Yes.

138
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,700
Shiggy told us

139
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,330
that the further down you go,
the less chance the ball has of rising.

140
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,700
I hope they've had
the previous ones.

141
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,640
Do you think
they'll get this one too?

142
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,020
In the Abyss,
our spirit materializes.

143
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,240
Go ahead.

144
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,670
If our fears take shape
around us,

145
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,540
why shouldn't the same be true
for our hopes?

146
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,140
You have to believe.
They have received the precedents,

147
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,240
and they'll get this one.

148
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,990
Yes.

149
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Oil does not repel
birds from the depths.

150
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't be depressed about it.

151
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,110
Your mother must have
often messed up.

152
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,430
Shall we go to bed?

153
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,630
Yes, I'm going to sulk in bed.

154
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,430
What is it?

155
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,080
Where is it?
She's gone! Nowhere to be found!

156
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,210
Prushka has disappeared,
I had it on me!

157
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,690
Where did it go?

158
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,490
Someone got our ball back,

159
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,110
followed us while eluding
my perception

160
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,470
and avoided Légu's traps

161
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,230
to leave this message.

162
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,730
Who could it be
and what does he want from us?

163
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,160
It's metallic.
But at least it's not blood.

164
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,990
Some kind of ore...

165
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,060
And there's a smell of grease.

166
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,400
He didn't bother
to cover his tracks,

167
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,270
he underestimates us!

168
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,500
Let's follow his trail
and pick up Prushka.

169
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,550
The force field is unharmed.

170
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,080
It's faint,
but I can smell Prushka.

171
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,600
- This way.
- That's a dog.

172
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,680
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Meinya found something!

173
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,690
What are these?
Small animal corpses?

174
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,680
Take a look,

175
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,310
their buttocks were sewn on.

176
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,660
There's flesh,
fat and hair.

177
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,340
Does it belong
to the one we're looking for?

178
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,420
Will it help to track him?

179
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,750
What's up?

180
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,810
I don't know, it's weird...

181
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,100
It's your hair
and Rico's.

182
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,610
Damn, he's right.

183
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,790
You're missing bits and pieces,

184
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,360
and I, tail hair.

185
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,760
In many places
that don't get noticed.

186
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,120
He did it while we were sleeping.

187
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,770
- What a jerk!
- It's creepy...

188
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,870
You don't want us
to turn back?

189
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,970
Let's get on with it.
That's not going to scare me!

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,070
Footprints.

191
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,200
A gigantic biped.

192
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Are we looking for him?

193
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,300
No idea,
but we're heading in the same direction.

194
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,810
It follows the scents
carried by the wind.

195
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,310
- Shall we?
- Yes!

196
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,480
Is it here?

197
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,880
I have a feeling we're going
some great encounters.

198
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,700
You think it's a building?

199
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,330
It looks like
the corpse of a creature.

200
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,320
Rico, Légu.

201
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,890
Have you noticed?

202
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,260
Top right.

203
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,640
It's the same symbol
as on the drawing!

204
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,320
What does it mean?

205
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't know, but...

206
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,750
We have to go and see!
And get Prushka!

207
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,480
Exactly.

208
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,720
It's relatively flat
until the starter,

209
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,010
we shouldn't have to bear the burden.

210
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,880
- All unknown species...
- Are you all right?

211
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,850
Let's make smoke
above us,

212
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,810
and if need be, protect us.

213
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,150
All right.

214
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
- Are you ready?
- All set.

215
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,550
Did you hear that?

216
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,320
- Huh? Heard what?
- Yes, but I don't know where it came from.

217
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,180
It sounded like a voice.

218
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,130
- Problem?
- Rico,

219
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,810
we're being watched,
but I don't know by what.

220
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,450
Let's keep moving,
it's dangerous to stop.

221
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,670
Did it belong to humans?

222
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,080
There's something
that repels smoke.

223
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,050
The force field, Nanatchy?

224
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,960
No,
I don't know what it is either.

225
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,720
I even have the impression
the force field stops here.

226
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,090
It's up to me, then...

227
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,790
Let me give it a try.

228
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,650
Thank you for overcoming your fear
for our sake.

229
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,050
That's it, I've crossed?

230
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
What's up? What's going on?

231
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,700
Ears, fingernails,
jaws, ribs...

232
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,240
What's it for?

233
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,850
What's all this?

234
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,440
What do you want?

235
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,870
I've never seen anything like it.
Don't provoke him, Légu!

236
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,690
You're also cavern makers,
aren't you?

237
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,120
Please forgive me.

238
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,780
A pleasure. My name is Majikaja.

239
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,500
You've come a long way.

240
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,260
Are you the one
who stole Prushka from me?

241
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,320
My white whistle, "Your Worth",
the reflection stone of life!

242
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,040
The stone is
in the hands of a specialist.

243
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,260
Please follow me.

244
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,030
Wait! Wait! Wait! Just a second!

245
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,480
We didn't know

246
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,650
than any human

247
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,930
could not leave this place
with his appearance intact.
